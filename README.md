# HumanForYou Employee Attrition Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition at **HumanForYou**, an Indian pharmaceutical company with approximately 4,000 employees. With an annual attrition rate of 15%, the company seeks to identify actionable insights and implement data-driven strategies to reduce turnover.  

## Objectives  
- Identify the key factors contributing to employee attrition.  
- Develop predictive models to assist in employee retention strategies.  
- Ensure ethical AI implementation aligned with the company's values.  

## Dataset Details  
The analysis utilizes anonymized data provided by HumanForYou's HR department, including:  
- **HR Data**: Employee demographics, job roles, salaries, and performance ratings.  
- **Survey Data**: Employee satisfaction, work environment, and work-life balance.  
- **Work Hours**: Entry and exit timestamps over a year to assess patterns.  

## Approach  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Examine data distribution, relationships, and trends.  
   - Handle missing values and data preprocessing.  
2. **Model Development**:  
   - Build classification models to predict employee attrition.  
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.  
   - Optimize and select the most effective model.  
3. **Ethical Considerations**:  
   - Address data privacy, fairness, and transparency.  
   - Ensure compliance with ethical AI principles, such as non-discrimination and robust decision-making.  

## Deliverables  
- A **Jupyter Notebook** with detailed documentation, visualizations, and insights.  
- A 20-minute presentation summarizing findings, methodologies, and recommendations.  

## Collaborators  
- **Eya Ben Doudou**
